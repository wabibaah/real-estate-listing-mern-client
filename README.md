how to get the google places api key
just get a gmail account
type "google developer console" in google and search for it
if you have existing apps they will be in the dropdown
create a new project (from the dropdown in the main navbar)
give a project name and hit create (he didn't give the location but you may give the location)
search for "places"
click on "Places Api"
make sure "Api Enabled" , you will have to enter your credit card information
copy your api key
when you are deploying it, try and do the "protect your api key section"
go to "Api & services"
pick the project that you are currently working on , click on credentials in the sidebar , click on "show key" in the far right
so all this that we have done is for the maps api key

now we will do for the "places key"
